# sql2migrations
Convert your .sql dump database file (only structure) into Laravel Migration files separate for each table with rollback options.

## Description

When generating laravel migrations, it can sometimes be a bit confusing as to the correct way to add columns or fields to your tables. There are a large amount of methods to use within the Schema and Blueprint classes to wrap your heads around. Many times, you might even have a database in place, but you would like to move this instance to another host, or simply have a blueprint of the database in a set of laravel migration files. Wouldnâ€™t it be great if we had a way to handle doing this for us automatically? In fact we do it now for you. Letâ€™s see how to put this in action.ðŸ˜˜
